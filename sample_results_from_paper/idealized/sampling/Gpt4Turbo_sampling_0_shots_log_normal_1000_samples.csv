## You are an expert on statistics. Your task is to sample a number from a given distribution. Do not write any code or use any additional tools to perform the sampling. Answer with just a numerical response. Make sure your final answer is enclosed by xml tags <answer> and </answer>

## Here are some examples to help you understand the task:



## Consider the following distribution:

  Distribution Type: Log-Normal Distribution
  Characteristics: This distribution models values that are the result of the multiplicative product of many independent random variables, such as income levels, stock prices, or city sizes.
  Log Mean (mu): 4.0
  Log Sigma (sigma): 0.5
  These parameters mean that the natural logarithm of the values follows a normal distribution with the specified mean and standard deviation.
  

## Instruction: Sample a number from the given distribution and output only the numerical value.
