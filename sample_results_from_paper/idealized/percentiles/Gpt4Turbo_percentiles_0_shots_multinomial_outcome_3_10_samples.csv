Question:
If outcome 3 appears 520.0 times, what is the percentile of this occurrence within the provided distribution?
Answer:
",89.7,"To find the percentile of outcome 3 appearing 520 times within a multinomial distribution of 1000 trials with probabilities [0.2, 0.3, 0.5], we can approximate the distribution of outcome 3 using a binomial distribution, as the trials are independent, and each trial results in outcome 3 with probability 0.5.

1. **Modeling the Distribution for Outcome 3**: 
   - Since outcome 3 has a probability of 0.5 per trial, and there are 1000 trials, outcome 3 follows a binomial distribution, \( B(n=1000, p=0.5) \).

2. **Calculating Percentile for 520 Occurrences**:
   - We need to compute the probability of getting up to 520 occurrences of outcome 3, which can be calculated using the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the binomial distribution.

Using the binomial distribution properties:
- Mean = \( np = 1000 \times 0.5 = 500 \)
- Standard Deviation = \( \sqrt{np(1-p)} = \sqrt{1000 \times 0.5 \times 0.5} = 15.81 \)

Using a normal approximation of the binomial distribution for ease (since \( n \) is large), the Z-score for 520 occurrences is calculated as:
\[ Z = \frac{520 - 500}{15.81} \approx 1.265 \]

Looking up the Z-score in a standard normal distribution table, or using a Z to percentile calculator:
- \( P(Z \leq 1.265) \) is approximately 89.7%.

Thus, the percentile of outcome 3 appearing 520 times is approximately:

Question:
If outcome 3 appears 537.0 times, what is the percentile of this occurrence within the provided distribution?
Answer:
",99,"To find the percentile of the occurrence where outcome 3 appears 537 times in a multinomial distribution with probabilities [0.2, 0.3, 0.5] over 1000 trials, we need to consider the distribution of the third category (outcome 3).

The mean number of times outcome 3 occurs is calculated as:
\[ \text{Mean} = 1000 \times 0.5 = 500 \]

The variance for the number of times outcome 3 occurs is:
\[ \text{Variance} = 1000 \times 0.5 \times (1 - 0.5) = 250 \]

The standard deviation is the square root of the variance:
\[ \text{Standard Deviation} = \sqrt{250} \approx 15.81 \]

Now, we standardize the score of 537 occurrences to find its Z-score:
\[ Z = \frac{537 - 500}{15.81} \approx 2.34 \]

Using the Z-score, we can find the percentile in a standard normal distribution. A Z-score of 2.34 approximately corresponds to the 99th percentile in a standard normal table.

Therefore, the percentile of outcome 3 appearing 537 times is:
