## Here is your question:
Question:
What is the percentile of the value 1.042 within the provided distribution?
Answer:
",1,"To find the percentile of the value 1.042 in an exponential distribution with a rate of 0.01, we first calculate the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for that value.

The CDF formula for the exponential distribution is:
\[ F(x) = 1 - e^{-\lambda x} \]
where \( \lambda \) is the rate (0.01 in this case), and \( x \) is the value (1.042).

Plugging in the values:
\[ F(1.042) = 1 - e^{-0.01 \times 1.042} \]
\[ F(1.042) = 1 - e^{-0.01042} \]
\[ F(1.042) = 1 - 0.98964 \] (approximately)
\[ F(1.042) = 0.01036 \]

To convert this to a percentile, multiply by 100:
\[ \text{Percentile} = 0.01036 \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentile} = 1.036 \]

Rounding to a whole number, the percentile rank of 1.042 is approximately:

Where:

## Here is your question:
Question:
What is the percentile of the value 35.554 within the provided distribution?
Answer:
",29.9,"To find the percentile of the value 35.554 in an exponential distribution with a rate (λ) of 0.01, we use the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for the exponential distribution. The CDF is given by:

\[ F(x) = 1 - e^{-\lambda x} \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ \lambda = 0.01 \]
\[ x = 35.554 \]

\[ F(35.554) = 1 - e^{-0.01 \times 35.554} \]
\[ F(35.554) = 1 - e^{-0.35554} \]
\[ F(35.554) = 1 - 0.701 \approx 0.299 \]

To express this CDF value as a percentile:
\[ 0.299 \times 100 = 29.9 \]

Thus, the value 35.554 is approximately at the 29.9th percentile of this distribution.

Question:
What is the percentile of the value 50.939 within the provided distribution?
Answer:
",39.943,"To find the percentile of the value 50.939 in an exponential distribution with a rate (λ) of 0.01, we first calculate the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for this value.

The CDF of an exponential distribution is given by:
\[ F(x) = 1 - e^{-\lambda x} \]

For λ = 0.01 and x = 50.939:
\[ F(50.939) = 1 - e^{-0.01 \times 50.939} \]
\[ F(50.939) = 1 - e^{-0.50939} \]
\[ F(50.939) = 1 - 0.60057 \approx 0.39943 \]

To convert this to a percentile:
\[ 0.39943 \times 100 = 39.943 \]

Thus, the percentile of the value 50.939 within this distribution is approximately:

## Here is your question:
Question:
What is the percentile of the value 120.101 within the provided distribution?
Answer:
",69.92,"To find the percentile of the value 120.101 in an exponential distribution with a rate (λ) of 0.01, we use the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for exponential distributions. The formula for the CDF is:

\[ F(x) = 1 - e^{-\lambda x} \]

Plugging in the given values:

\[ F(120.101) = 1 - e^{-0.01 \times 120.101} \]
\[ = 1 - e^{-1.20101} \]
\[ = 1 - e^{-1.20101} \]
\[ = 1 - 0.3008 \approx 0.6992 \]

To convert to a percentile, multiply by 100:

\[ 0.6992 \times 100 = 69.92 \]

Thus, the value 120.101 is approximately at the 69.92nd percentile in this distribution.

Answer:
",69.928,"To find the percentile of the value 120.101 in an exponential distribution with a rate of 0.01, we use the cumulative distribution function (CDF) formula for exponential distribution:

\[ F(x) = 1 - e^{-\lambda x} \]

where \( \lambda \) is the rate parameter (0.01 in this case), and \( x \) is the value for which we want to find the percentile (120.101).

Plugging in the values:

\[ F(120.101) = 1 - e^{-0.01 \times 120.101} \]
\[ F(120.101) = 1 - e^{-1.20101} \]
\[ F(120.101) = 1 - e^{-1.20101} \approx 1 - 0.30072 \]
\[ F(120.101) = 0.69928 \]

What is the percentile of the value 120.101 within the provided distribution?
Answer:
",70,"To find the percentile of the value 120.101 in an exponential distribution with a rate of 0.01, we first calculate the cumulative distribution function (CDF) at 120.101.

The formula for the CDF of the exponential distribution is:
\[ F(x) = 1 - e^{-\lambda x} \]
where \( \lambda \) is the rate parameter, and \( x \) is the value for which we are calculating the CDF.

Given:
\[ \lambda = 0.01 \]
\[ x = 120.101 \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ F(120.101) = 1 - e^{-0.01 \times 120.101} \]
\[ = 1 - e^{-1.20101} \]
\[ = 1 - e^{-1.20101} \]
\[ \approx 1 - 0.30079 \]
\[ \approx 0.69921 \]

To convert this to a percentile, multiply by 100:

Answer:
",70,"To find the percentile of the value \( x = 120.101 \) in an exponential distribution with a rate \( \lambda = 0.01 \), we use the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the exponential distribution.

The formula for the CDF of an exponential distribution is:
\[ F(x) = 1 - e^{-\lambda x} \]

Substituting \( \lambda = 0.01 \) and \( x = 120.101 \):
\[ F(120.101) = 1 - e^{-0.01 \times 120.101} \]
\[ F(120.101) = 1 - e^{-1.20101} \]
\[ F(120.101) = 1 - e^{-1.20101} \approx 1 - 0.30079 \]
\[ F(120.101) \approx 0.69921 \]
