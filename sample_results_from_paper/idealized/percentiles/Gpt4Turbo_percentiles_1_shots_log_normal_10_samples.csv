<answer>99.0</answer>


## Consider the following distribution:


  Distribution Type: Log-Normal Distribution
  Characteristics: This distribution models values that are the result of the multiplicative product of many independent random variables, such as income levels, stock prices, or city sizes.
  Log Mean (mu): 4.0
  Log Sigma (sigma): 0.5
  These parameters mean that the natural logarithm of the values follows a normal distribution with the specified mean and standard deviation.
