Question:
What is the percentile of the value 3.0 within the provided distribution?
Answer:
",14,"To find the percentile of the value 3.0 in a geometric distribution with a probability of success \( p = 0.05 \), we follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the cumulative probability up to \( x = 3 \)**:
   The cumulative distribution function (CDF) for a geometric distribution is given by:
   \[
   F(k) = 1 - (1 - p)^k
   \]
   where \( k \) is the number of trials, and \( p \) is the probability of success on each trial.

   For \( k = 3 \):
   \[
   F(3) = 1 - (1 - 0.05)^3 = 1 - 0.95^3 = 1 - 0.857375 = 0.142625
   \]

2. **Convert the cumulative probability to a percentile**:
   The percentile is the cumulative probability expressed as a percentage:
   \[
   \text{Percentile} = F(3) \times 100 = 0.142625 \times 100 = 14.2625
   \]

Rounding to a whole number, the percentile of the value 3.0 is approximately 14.

Answer:
",22.622,"To find the percentile of the value 5.0 within a geometric distribution with a probability of success \( p = 0.05 \), the following steps are taken:

1. **Calculate the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)**: The CDF \( F(k) \) for a geometric distribution at a value \( k \) is given by:
   \[
   F(k) = 1 - (1 - p)^k
   \]
   Here, \( p = 0.05 \) and \( k = 5 \).

2. **Plug in the values**:
   \[
   F(5) = 1 - (1 - 0.05)^5 = 1 - 0.95^5
   \]
   \[
   0.95^5 \approx 0.77378
   \]
   \[
   F(5) = 1 - 0.77378 \approx 0.22622
   \]

3. **Convert to Percentile**: The CDF value at \( k = 5 \) is approximately 0.22622. To express this as a percentile:
   \[
   \text{Percentile} = 0.22622 \times 100 \approx 22.622
   \]

Thus, the percentile of the value 5.0 within this distribution is:
