Question:
What is the percentile of the value 1081.612 within the provided distribution?
Answer:
",39.8,"To calculate the percentile of the value 1081.612 in a Gumbel distribution with a location parameter of 1000 and a scale parameter of 1000, we use the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Gumbel distribution.

The CDF of the Gumbel distribution is given by:
\[ F(x) = \exp\left(-\exp\left(-\frac{x-\mu}{\beta}\right)\right) \]
where \( \mu \) is the location parameter and \( \beta \) is the scale parameter.

Plugging in the values:
\[ \mu = 1000 \]
\[ \beta = 1000 \]
\[ x = 1081.612 \]

The formula becomes:
\[ F(1081.612) = \exp\left(-\exp\left(-\frac{1081.612 - 1000}{1000}\right)\right) \]
\[ = \exp\left(-\exp\left(-0.081612\right)\right) \]
\[ = \exp\left(-\exp\left(-0.081612\right)\right) \]
\[ = \exp\left(-0.9217\right) \]
\[ \approx 0.3979 \]

To convert this to a percentile, we multiply by 100:
\[ 0.3979 \times 100 = 39.79 \]

Plugging in the values:

- \( \beta = 1000 \)

\[ F(1081.612) = \exp(-\exp(-\frac{1081.612 - 1000}{1000})) \]
\[ = \exp(-\exp(-\frac{81.612}{1000})) \]
\[ = \exp(-\exp(-0.081612)) \]

\[ ≈ 0.3976 \]

Answer:
",40,"To find the percentile of the value 1081.612 within a Gumbel distribution with a location of 1000 and a scale of 1000, we will utilize the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for the Gumbel distribution. The CDF is given by:

where \( \mu \) is the location parameter, \( \beta \) is the scale parameter, and \( x \) is the value for which we are calculating the percentile.

Plugging the values into the formula:
\[ \mu = 1000 \]
\[ \beta = 1000 \]
\[ x = 1081.612 \]

\[ F(1081.612) = e^{-e^{-\frac{1081.612 - 1000}{1000}}} \]
\[ F(1081.612) = e^{-e^{-0.081612}} \]
\[ F(1081.612) = e^{-0.922036} \]
\[ F(1081.612) \approx 0.397941 \]
