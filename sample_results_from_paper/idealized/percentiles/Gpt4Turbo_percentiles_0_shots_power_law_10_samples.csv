Question:
What is the percentile of the value 188.606 within the provided distribution?
Answer:
",68.16,"To find the percentile of the value 188.606 in a power law distribution with parameters \(\alpha = 1.8\) and \(x_{\min} = 100\), we need to calculate the cumulative distribution function (CDF) up to that value.

The CDF \( F(x) \) for a power law distribution is given by:
\[ F(x) = 1 - \left(\frac{x_{\min}}{x}\right)^{\alpha - 1} \]

Plugging in the values:
\[ F(188.606) = 1 - \left(\frac{100}{188.606}\right)^{1.8 - 1} \]

First, calculate the exponent:
\[ \alpha - 1 = 1.8 - 1 = 0.8 \]

Then compute the ratio and raise it to the power of 0.8:
\[ \left(\frac{100}{188.606}\right)^{0.8} \approx 0.3184 \]

Therefore, the CDF at 188.606 is:
\[ F(188.606) = 1 - 0.3184 = 0.6816 \]

To express this as a percentile:
\[ 0.6816 \times 100 = 68.16 \]

Hence, the percentile of 188.606 in this distribution is approximately:

Question:
What is the percentile of the value 188.606 within the provided distribution?
Answer:
",58.52,"To find the percentile of the value 188.606 within a power law distribution with parameters alpha = 1.8 and xmin = 100, we can use the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the power law distribution.

The CDF of a power law distribution is given by:
\[ F(x) = 1 - \left(\frac{x}{x_{\text{min}}}\right)^{-\alpha + 1} \]

Plugging in the values:
- \( x = 188.606 \)
- \( \alpha = 1.8 \)
- \( x_{\text{min}} = 100 \)

\[ F(188.606) = 1 - \left(\frac{188.606}{100}\right)^{-1.8 + 1} = 1 - \left(1.88606\right)^{-0.8} \]

Calculating \( (1.88606)^{-0.8} \):
\[ (1.88606)^{-0.8} \approx 0.4148 \]

So,
\[ F(188.606) = 1 - 0.4148 = 0.5852 \]

To convert it to a percentile:
\[ 0.5852 \times 100 = 58.52 \]

Thus, the percentile of the value 188.606 is approximately:

Question:
What is the percentile of the value 311.535 within the provided distribution?
Answer:
",73.8,"To find the percentile of the value 311.535 in a power law distribution with parameters alpha = 1.8 and xmin = 100, we use the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the power law distribution.

The CDF of a power law distribution, given \( x \geq x_{\text{min}} \), is:

\[
F(x) = 1 - \left( \frac{x}{x_{\text{min}}} \right)^{-(\alpha - 1)}
\]

Substituting in the given values (\( \alpha = 1.8 \), \( x_{\text{min}} = 100 \), \( x = 311.535 \)):

\[
F(311.535) = 1 - \left( \frac{311.535}{100} \right)^{-(1.8 - 1)}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
F(311.535) = 1 - \left( 3.11535 \right)^{-0.8}
\]

Calculating \( 3.11535^{-0.8} \):

\[
3.11535^{-0.8} \approx 0.262
\]

So,

\[
F(311.535) = 1 - 0.262 \approx 0.738
\]

To convert this to a percentile:

\[
0.738 \times 100 = 73.8
\]

Thus, the percentile of the value 311.535 in this distribution is approximately:
