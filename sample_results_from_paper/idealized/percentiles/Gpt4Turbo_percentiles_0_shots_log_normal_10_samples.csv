## Here is your question:
Question:
What is the percentile of the value 28.749 within the provided distribution?
Answer:
",10,"To find the percentile of the value 28.749 within a log-normal distribution with parameters mu = 4.0 and sigma = 0.5, we first need to convert the value into the corresponding value of the underlying normal distribution, using the transformation \( Z = \log(X) \).

Given:
- \( X = 28.749 \)
- \( \mu = 4.0 \)
- \( \sigma = 0.5 \)

We calculate:
\[ Z = \log(28.749) \]
\[ Z \approx 3.359 \]

Next, we standardize this value to get the Z-score in the context of a normal distribution:
\[ Z_{score} = \frac{Z - \mu}{\sigma} \]
\[ Z_{score} = \frac{3.359 - 4.0}{0.5} \]
\[ Z_{score} \approx -1.282 \]

Now, we find the cumulative probability for this Z-score from the standard normal distribution:
\[ P(Z \leq -1.282) \approx 0.1 \]

Thus, the value 28.749 is approximately at the 10th percentile of the given log-normal distribution.

Question:
What is the percentile of the value 70.762 within the provided distribution?
Answer:
",69.73,"To find the percentile of the value 70.762 in a log-normal distribution with parameters μ = 4.0 and σ = 0.5, we first need to convert the value into its corresponding z-score under the logarithmic normal distribution.

1. **Convert the value to its log-scale**:
   \[
   x = \ln(70.762) \approx 4.259
   \]

2. **Calculate the z-score**:
   The z-score is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} = \frac{4.259 - 4.0}{0.5} = 0.518
   \]

3. **Find the cumulative probability of this z-score under a normal distribution**:
   Using a standard normal distribution table or calculator, find the cumulative probability for z = 0.518. This value corresponds to approximately:
   \[
   P = 0.6973
   \]

4. **Convert the probability to a percentile**:
   Multiply the cumulative probability by 100 to get the percentile:
   \[
   Percentile = 0.6973 \times 100 \approx 69.73
   \]

Thus, the percentile of the value 70.762 within the given log-normal distribution is approximately:
