  Characteristics: A generalization of the normal distribution to accommodate skewness.
  Location: 100 (Shifts the distribution along the x-axis.)
  Scale: 10 (Controls the spread of the distribution.)
  Skew: -10 (Determines the direction and degree of skewness.)
  

## Here is your question:
Question:
Considering only values including and between the 1st percentile and the 99th percentile, what is the probability that a value from the provided distribution is between 74.442 and 100.795?
Answer:
