## You are an expert on statistics. Your task is to estimate the probability of being in a range of values within a given distribution. Answer with just a numerical response from 0 to 1, representing the probability. Make sure your final answer is enclosed by xml tags <answer> and </answer>.

## Here are some examples to help you understand the task:



## Consider the following distribution:

  Distribution Type: Log-Normal Distribution
  Characteristics: This distribution models values that are the result of the multiplicative product of many independent random variables, such as income levels, stock prices, or city sizes.
  Log Mean (mu): 4.0
  Log Sigma (sigma): 0.5
  These parameters mean that the natural logarithm of the values follows a normal distribution with the specified mean and standard deviation.
  

## Here is your question:
Question:
Considering only values including and between the 1st percentile and the 99th percentile, what is the probability that a value from the provided distribution is between 51.38 and 58.175?

## You are an expert on statistics. Your task is to estimate the probability of being in a range of values within a given distribution. Answer with just a numerical response from 0 to 1, representing the probability. Make sure your final answer is enclosed by xml tags <answer> and </answer>.

## Here are some examples to help you understand the task:



## Consider the following distribution:

  Distribution Type: Log-Normal Distribution
  Characteristics: This distribution models values that are the result of the multiplicative product of many independent random variables, such as income levels, stock prices, or city sizes.
  Log Mean (mu): 4.0
  Log Sigma (sigma): 0.5
  These parameters mean that the natural logarithm of the values follows a normal distribution with the specified mean and standard deviation.
  

## Here is your question:
Question:
Considering only values including and between the 1st percentile and the 99th percentile, what is the probability that a value from the provided distribution is between 17.062 and 173.23?
Answer:
",0.95,<answer>0.95</answer>
