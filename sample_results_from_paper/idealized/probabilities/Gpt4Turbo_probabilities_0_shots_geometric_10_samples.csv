Question:
Considering only values including and between the 1st percentile and the 99th percentile, what is the probability that a value from the provided distribution is between 10.0 and 18.0?
Answer:
",0.2529,"To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of the geometric distribution and calculate the cumulative probabilities at the points of interest.

The distribution in question is a geometric distribution with a probability of success \( p = 0.05 \).

The probability mass function (PMF) of a geometric distribution is given by:
\[ P(X = k) = (1-p)^{k-1} \times p \]
for \( k = 1, 2, 3, \dots \)

The cumulative distribution function (CDF), which gives us the probability that the random variable \( X \) is less than or equal to a certain value \( k \), is given by:
\[ P(X \leq k) = 1 - (1-p)^k \]

We are asked to find \( P(10 \leq X \leq 18) \). This probability can be calculated using the CDF as follows:
\[ P(10 \leq X \leq 18) = P(X \leq 18) - P(X < 10) \]
\[ = P(X \leq 18) - P(X \leq 9) \]
\[ = [1 - (1-0.05)^{18}] - [1 - (1-0.05)^9] \]

Calculating these values:
- \( (1 - 0.05)^{18} \approx 0.377353602 \)
- \( (1 - 0.05)^9 \approx 0.630249409 \)

Thus:
\[ P(X \leq 18) = 1 - 0.377353602 = 0.622646398 \]
\[ P(X \leq 9) = 1 - 0.630249409 = 0.369750591 \]

Finally:
\[ P(10 \leq X \leq 18) = 0.622646398 - 0.369750591 = 0.252895807 \]

Therefore, the probability that a value from this geometric distribution is between 10.0 and 18.0 is approximately 0.2529.

## Consider the following distribution:

  Distribution Type: Geometric Distribution
  Characteristics: Models the number of trials until the first success.
  Probability of Success: 0.05
  

## Here is your question:
Question:
Considering only values including and between the 1st percentile and the 99th percentile, what is the probability that a value from the provided distribution is between 10.0 and 18.0?
Answer:
",0.235910,"To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of the geometric distribution falling between the values of 10.0 and 18.0.

Given:
- Probability of success (p) = 0.05
- Distribution Type: Geometric Distribution

The probability mass function (PMF) for a geometric distribution is given by:
\[ P(X = k) = (1-p)^{k-1} \times p \]
where \( k \) is the number of trials until the first success.

We need to find \( P(10 \leq X \leq 18) \), which is:
\[ P(10 \leq X \leq 18) = P(X = 10) + P(X = 11) + ... + P(X = 18) \]

Calculating each term:
- \( P(X = 10) = (1-0.05)^{10-1} \times 0.05 = 0.95^9 \times 0.05 \approx 0.031940 \)
- \( P(X = 11) = 0.95^{10} \times 0.05 \approx 0.030343 \)
- \( P(X = 12) = 0.95^{11} \times 0.05 \approx 0.028826 \)
- \( P(X = 13) = 0.95^{12} \times 0.05 \approx 0.027384 \)
- \( P(X = 14) = 0.95^{13} \times 0.05 \approx 0.026015 \)
- \( P(X = 15) = 0.95^{14} \times 0.05 \approx 0.024714 \)
- \( P(X = 16) = 0.95^{15} \times 0.05 \approx 0.023379 \)
- \( P(X = 17) = 0.95^{16} \times 0.05 \approx 0.022210 \)
- \( P(X = 18) = 0.95^{17} \times 0.05 \approx 0.021099 \)

Summing these probabilities:
\[ P(10 \leq X \leq 18) \approx 0.031940 + 0.030343 + 0.028826 + 0.027384 + 0.026015 + 0.024714 + 0.023379 + 0.022210 + 0.021099 \approx 0.235910 \]

Therefore, the probability that a value from this geometric distribution is between 10.0 and 18.0 is:
