## You are an expert on statistics. Your task is to estimate the probability of being in a range of values within a given distribution. Answer with just a numerical response from 0 to 1, representing the probability. Make sure your final answer is enclosed by xml tags <answer> and </answer>.

## Here are some examples to help you understand the task:



## Consider the following distribution:

  Distribution Type: Power Law Distribution
