## Here are some examples to help you understand the task:



## Consider the following distribution:

  Distribution Type: Uniform Distribution
  Characteristics: All values within the interval have equal probability of occurring.
  Min: 70 (Minimum value of the distribution.)
  Max: 130 (Maximum value of the distribution.)
  

## Here is your question:
Question:
Considering only values including and between the 1st percentile and the 99th percentile, what is the probability that a value from the provided distribution is between 88.181 and 111.899?
Answer:
",0.3953,"To solve this problem, we first need to understand the properties of a uniform distribution between min = 70 and max = 130.

1. **Uniform Distribution Range**: The range of the distribution is from 70 to 130.

2. **Width of the Distribution**: The width of the distribution is \(130 - 70 = 60\).

3. **Density of the Distribution**: Since this is a uniform distribution, the probability density function (PDF) is constant across the interval. The density \(f(x)\) is given by \(f(x) = \frac{1}{\text{width of distribution}} = \frac{1}{60}\).

4. **Probability Calculation**:
   - **Lower Bound**: 88.181
   - **Upper Bound**: 111.899

   To find the probability of a value falling between 88.181 and 111.899, we calculate the proportion of the interval [88.181, 111.899] relative to the entire distribution range [70, 130].

   - Length of the interval of interest: \(111.899 - 88.181 = 23.718\).
   - Probability: The probability is the length of the interval of interest divided by the total width of the distribution:
   \[
   P(88.181 \leq X \leq 111.899) = \frac{23.718}{60}
   \]

   - Calculation: \( \frac{23.718}{60} = 0.3953 \)

Thus, the probability that a value from this uniform distribution is between 88.181 and 111.899 is approximately 0.3953.
