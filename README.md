# LLMs-and-Probabilistic-Reasoning

This repository contains the data and software artifacts for the arXiv paper ["What Are the Odds? Language Models Are Capable of Probabilistic Reasoning"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12830).

## Overview

This repository is organized into several key components:

1. **Generation**:
   - `idealized_generation/`: Contains scripts for generating idealized distributions and prompts.
   - `real_world_generation/`: Scripts for generating distributions and prompts based on real-world data.

2. **Sample Results from Paper**:
   - This folder contains the sample results presented in the paper, organized by experiment type.

3. **Templates**:
   - Contains template code used for generating idealized and real-world distirbutions.

4. **Notebook**:
   - `EMNLP_2024_tutorial.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook that provides an interactive tutorial on using the provided scripts to generate datasets and load results from the paper (which can be found in `sample_results_from_paper/`.)

## Installation

This section is a work-in-progress depending on where exactly this code ends up being released.
